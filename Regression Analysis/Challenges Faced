Initial Difficulties:
•	Doing research and analyzing Ride share tendency analysis in smart cities was the initial challenge. To get a clear picture on understanding of smart cities, 
  exploration of transportation systems and then went into AI enabled architecture. It took us enough time on understanding “How to leverage AI models by integrating 
  them into our dashboard techniques.”
•	Finding recent datasets on post-pandemic e-scooter usage in U.S. states and conducting ride-share tendency analysis in smart cities was quite a challenge, 
  especially given the need for up-to-date information amidst rapidly changing conditions.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
•	Missing Values: I have encountered missing values in some columns of your e-scooter data (e.g., 'Vendor' or 'Trip Distance') which I need to handle by imputation or removal. 
•	Inconsistent Data Formats: Inconsistent date/time formats in the 'Start Time' and 'End Time' columns could have caused issues before converting them to a standard format. 
•	Outliers: The presence of outliers in features like 'Trip Distance' will potentially affect the results of regression analysis. So, it was a challenge to remove and identify all the outliers.

Feature Engineering: 
•	Choosing Appropriate Features: Selecting the most relevant features for model (e.g., including 'hour_of_day' but not 'day_of_week' for all seasons) requires exploration and experimentation. 
•	Feature Creation Errors: Initially I have encountered bugs in the code for creating features like 'day_of_week' or 'season' from timestamps, leading to incorrect feature values. 
•	Navigating through new datasets, especially e-scooter and bike data alongside weather data, posed a significant challenge. Pinpointing weather-related patterns within specific time 
  frames demanded considerable time and effort. Moreover, accessing historical weather data proved to be a hurdle, lacking readily available resources.

Modeling: 
•	Multicollinearity: There is a need to check for multicollinearity among all the independent variables, I choose like “day_of_the_week”, “season”, 
  “weekend”, duration, and distnace as correlated features affects the model's stability. 
•	Convergence Issues: In most cases, the Poisson regression model might not be able to converge due to issues like separation. 
  So, I need to adjust model parameters and handle these issues before obtaining results. 

Evaluation: 
•	Interpreting Coefficients: Accurately interpreting the coefficients and p-values from the Poisson regression model is 
  crucial to understand the impact of each feature on ride-sharing counts. And trying to indicate the significance using “p” value is a bit of a challenge. 

Choosing the Right Performance Metric: 
•	RMSE might not be the most suitable metric for evaluating a count model which I am using Poisson regression. So, I considered using alternative metrics 
  like Mean Absolute Error (MAE). 
•	Handling the extensive data volume posed a challenge during model training and evaluation, demanding considerable time investment. 
  However, the outcomes proved to be substantial and meaningful.

General Challenges: 
•	Data Availability: Limited data for certain time periods or weather conditions restricted our analysis and model generalizability. 
•	Understanding Sponsor Feedback: Interpreting and effectively incorporating sponsor’s suggestions regarding e-scooter vs. bike data, 
  weather data, and separate models parallelly following the research papers provided by our sponsor and doing the analysis was a bit challenging.
